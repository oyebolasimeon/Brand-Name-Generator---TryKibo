# Brand Name Generator

## Introduction

You have been taught about variable and data types. You are going to use that knowledge to build a `brand name generator`.
This project has a starter file that contains the HTMl and JS for the task.

# Your Task

Most people find it difficult to come up with a brand name. To solve this problem you are going to build a simple brand name generator. To build this, follow the instruction below

## Part 1

To get started open the `script.js` file in the starter file and follow the instruction below.

- Write a prompt function that asks the user which city they grew up in and save their response in a variable.
- Write another prompt function that asks the user the name of their pet and save their response in a variable
- Remember a prompt function can be used to ask a user a question
- Example:

        const name = prompt("What is your name ?");

## Part 2

After asking for the city the user grew up and their pet's name in part 1, you will now use the response to generate a brand name for the user. Follow the steps below to acheive this

- Write an `alert` function to tell the user the name you suggest for their brand
- Remember an `alert` function is used to deliver a message to a user
- Example:

        alert("My name is Simeon");

- Suppose the city one of the users grew up in is Lagos and the name of their pet is Bingo, let the message passed to the alert function be in the format

       alert("The name of your brand can be Lagos Bingo");
